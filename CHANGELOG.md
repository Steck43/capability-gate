## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Named empty-diff BREAK: CI job `craft (empty-diff)` runs `.floor/craft/empty_diff_gate.py`. An empty `base...head` range fails. `changelog_gate` skip-green on non-user-facing ranges is a different job and is not this BREAK.
- Senior craft floor: craft (voice), craft (changelog), craft (comments) required CI jobs.
- Dev container pinned by digest, with pre-commit, ruff, and checksummed gitleaks 8.30.1 so a Codespace arrives with the local floor wired.
